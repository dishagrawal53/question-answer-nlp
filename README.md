# EduQuiz-Smart tool for generating Subjective and Objective questions
EduQuiz is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to streamline the creation of customized objective and subjective test questions from any provided text. In educational settings, creating effective tests can often be a time-consuming and tedious task. This application aims to simplify and expedite that process, allowing teachers, instructors, and even students to generate high-quality questions for their study materials or exams. By harnessing the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP), this application transforms input text into meaningful and contextually relevant questions, saving time and providing a valuable resource for both educators and learners.
The system is designed with a simple and intuitive web interface where users can submit a passage or body of text, select the desired test type (objective or subjective), and specify the number of questions they wish to generate. Based on this input, the application dynamically creates test questions that are contextually relevant and aligned with the input material.
The application is divided into two features:
1. Objective Test Generator: This generates fill-in-the-blank style questions using NLP-based sentence parsing and part-of-speech tagging. It identifies key noun phrases and replaces them with blanks, while also giving the answer.
2. Subjective Test Generator: This generates descriptive questions using common academic question prompts. It extracts meaningful noun phrases and builds questions like “Define” or “Explain in detail” and provides relevant answer based on input text.
This system not only reduces the manual effort involved in question paper creation but also ensures that the generated tests are content-specific and grammatically sound. It serves as a practical tool for teachers and students who require quick and reliable test generation based on any textual content. In the future, this system can be expanded with features such as question difficulty ranking, integration with educational platforms, and support for other languages, making it a comprehensive solution for automated test creation in educational technology

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In traditional education systems, creating comprehensive and effective test questions is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. Teachers often spend hours crafting multiple-choice and open-ended questions from textbooks, lectures, or other study materials. This process can be repetitive and prone to human error, and it can be particularly challenging when trying to generate high-quality subjective questions that require careful analysis of the material. 
As a result, educators and learners face challenges in efficiently generating relevant and diverse questions that align with specific learning objectives. To address these challenges, there is a need for an automated system that can generate test questions from any given text input, ensuring contextual relevance, grammatical accuracy, and variety in question types. Such a system should be capable of understanding the structure and semantics of the input content and produce questions that assess comprehension and recall effectively.
This project addresses the problem by developing a Flask-based web application that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate both objective and subjective questions. By minimizing manual intervention and providing quick, relevant assessments, the system aims to streamline the test creation process for educators and support adaptive learning environments
